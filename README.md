# AWS-Terraform-Ansible-ELK Stack
The ELK Stack is a collection of three open-source products: Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana. An ELK stack gives you the ability to aggregate logs from all your systems and applications, analyze these logs, and create visualizations for application and infrastructure monitoring, faster troubleshooting, analytics, and more.

* Logstash is a tool for collecting, parsing, and transforming logs and other data from different sources.

* Elasticsearch is a distributed search engine that stores and indexes large amounts of data.

* Kibana is a data visualization tool that allows you to create interactive dashboards and reports. It helps you to easily search and visualize data from Elasticsearch.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

In this project, I use Terraform as the Infrastructure as Code provisioner to deploy the necssary resources for the ELK stack into AWS. Ansible is the configuration management tool used to install and configure the components for Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana.
